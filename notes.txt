Remaining problems:

    - web.xml is not reformatted
    - injecting external lib at runtime is still not possible
    - command outputs from shell scripts cannot be displayed via gradle tasks

Todo task:

    - Running Jasper JSP compilation task with pure Gradle
    - Try compiling a JSP file with tag <include>, which references to another JSP file
